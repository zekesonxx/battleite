# Battleite
Yeah, I actually called it that.

This is a small pokemon-esque text "adventure" in which you fight things.
There are four dungeons you can fight through.

As a debug utility that I never removed, you can type `_debug_mobs` on the main screen to manually enter a fight with one of the earlier mobs. 

Made as part of my Programming in Java class at an ID Tech Camp in 2014.

This is, in no way, intended to be an actual game. I wrote it in a couple days as a way of learning Java. As a result, I will likely never do any more work on this.

You can play it by downloading battleite.jar and running:

    java -jar /path/to/battleite.jar
